# Vrijleven

> **Vrij Leven** (Dutch), To live free

This online space is **not** about living without money or possessions, but rather how to examine our lifes and be able to define our own values and virtues. This is also not a self-help book which will cure you of all your addictions, but rather my personal logbook of things I found helpfull on my path to a 'vrijleven'. I invite you to be a spectator to my journey. And if you want you can use some of my findings to incorporate into your own path.
